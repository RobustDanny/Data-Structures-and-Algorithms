# Data Structures and Algorithms PHP

Important notes during education:

1. Linear(proportional) complexity - loop must run 5 times since there are 5 values in the array
2. One operation in an algorithm can be understoor as something we do in each iteraction of the
   algorithm or for each piece of data, that takes constant time
3. The most immportant from bubble sort that we can notice in this simulation is that best and
   worst care is actually almost the same for selection sort O(n^2), but for bubble sort the best
   case runtime is only O(n)
4. Whether you use a Hash Set or a Hash Map depends on that you need just to know if something is
   there, or to find detailed info about it
5. Hash Set has constant time O(1) for: searching, adding, removing elements. IF all elements in
   unique bucket!
6. In worst case Hash Set has time complexity O(n) like an array, because elements with the same
   hash code should comtens in the same bucket. This bucket stays an array and array has time
   complaxity O(n). Same for Hash Map
7. Hash Map is something like Hash Set + assosietive array
