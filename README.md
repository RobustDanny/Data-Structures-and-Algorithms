# Data Structures and Algorithms PHP

Important notes during education:

1. Linear(proportional) complexity - loop must run 5 times since there are 5 values in the array
2. One operation in an algorithm can be understoor as something we do in each iteraction of the
   algorithm or for each piece of data, that takes constant time
